## Overview
https://trello.com/c/z6jCc0Q8/4-yos-documentation-devlog

### Background
After realizing that my first blog, [[개인 블로그 Subbrain 개발기|Subbrain]], which was based on Jekyll, has a few problems.
- Too hard to deploy article.
- Hard to Add advanced features such as Comments, Likes, and SPA.
- Nasty Web desgin.
- The Used tech stacks are not relevant to my career.

So I have decided to create new blog based on a 4-tier architecture : "YOS(Yun's OS)".
It will features likes
- Better Web design
- One click Article deployment
- Better project document .
- High-availability and Load-balancing
- Considering real business problems like security, legal jobs, cost etc...
- Unique and funny features.

I hope to receive some good luck!

## Roadmaps
I estimated that it will take 7~9 months to complete this project.
There are several reasons of the long schedule.
	- I can't dedicate full time to this project.
- I have limited knowledge of the required tech stacks.
- It's a solo project.
